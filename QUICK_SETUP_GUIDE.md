# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide - Your Expense Tracker

## ✅ What's Already Done

1. **Environment Variables** - `.env.local` created with your Supabase credentials
2. **Authentication System** - Email, PIN, and Google OAuth ready
3. **Onboarding Foundation** - Types, logic, and components created
4. **Database Schema** - SQL migrations ready to run

## 📋 Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations (5 minutes)

Open your Supabase Dashboard and run these SQL scripts:

**1. First, run the email auth migration:**
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
scripts/005_add_email_auth.sql
```

**2. Then, run the user preferences migration:**
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
scripts/006_add_user_preferences.sql
```

**Quick way to run both:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/spaqojtrouehuzqdjgfz/sql
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy content from `scripts/005_add_email_auth.sql`
4. Click "Run"
5. Create another new query
6. Copy content from `scripts/006_add_user_preferences.sql`
7. Click "Run"

### Step 2: Verify Google OAuth Setup (2 minutes)

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Authentication → Providers
2. Find "Google" provider
3. Verify it's **Enabled** ✅
4. Check that Client ID and Secret are filled in

**In Supabase URL Configuration:**
1. Go to Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Site URL should be: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Add Redirect URL: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`

### Step 3: Test Your App (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if not done)
pnpm install

# 2. Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# 3. Start development server
pnpm dev
```

**Then test:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000/auth
2. Try Google login - Click "Continue with Google"
3. Try Email signup - Switch to Email tab, create account
4. Try PIN signup - Switch to PIN tab, create account

### Step 4: Check Database (2 minutes)

After testing, verify users were created:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT id, username, email, created_at 
FROM users 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

You should see your test users!
