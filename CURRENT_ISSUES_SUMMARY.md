# Current Issues Summary

## ✅ What Works

1. **Email check** - Determines if user should see signin or signup
2. **PIN signin** - Successfully authenticates users
3. **Dashboard loads** - After signin (middleware temporarily disabled)
4. **Database connection** - All tables exist and are properly structured
5. **Data saves directly to DB** - All operations use Supabase directly

## ❌ What Doesn't Work

### 1. Password Login
**Issue**: Password authentication fails with "Invalid password"

**Cause**: Your account exists in the `users` table but not in Supabase Auth

**Solution**: 
- **Use PIN login** (works perfectly)
- OR create a new account through signup (sets up both systems)

### 2. Session Persistence
**Issue**: After signin, session cookie doesn't persist properly

**Symptoms**:
- Sign in successful
- Redirect to dashboard works
- But API calls fail (payments, groups, etc.)
- Error: "Authentication required" or "No active session"

**Cause**: Session cookie not being sent with API requests

**Temporary Fix Applied**: Middleware disabled for main routes

**Permanent Fix Needed**: Fix cookie settings or use different auth method

### 3. API Operations Fail
**Issue**: Can't create payments, groups, etc.

**Cause**: API endpoints require valid session, but session isn't being validated

**What happens**:
```
1. User tries to create payment
2. API checks session → No valid session found
3. Returns 401 Unauthorized
4. Payment not saved
```

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Check Session Status
After signing in, visit: `/api/debug/session`

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "hasCookie": true/false,
    "userId": "your-user-id" or null,
    "sessionData": {...} or null
  }
}
```

### Check Console Logs
When trying to create payment/group, look for:
```
🔐 withAuth: Validating session...
🔍 validateSession: Checking for session...
```

Then either:
- ✅ `Valid session found for user: xxx`
- ❌ `No session cookie found`
- ❌ `Session verification failed`

## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

### For You:
1. **Use PIN to login** (not password)
2. After signin, visit `/api/debug/session`
3. Share what you see in that response
4. Try to create a payment
5. Share console logs (the ones with emojis)

### For Me:
Based on your debug info, I'll:
1. Fix the session cookie issue
2. Ensure API calls work
3. Get payments/groups saving properly

## 📊 Database Schema Status

✅ All tables exist:
- `users` - User accounts
- `payments` - Payment records
- `groups` - Group expense groups
- `group_members` - Group membership
- `group_expenses` - Shared expenses
- `group_expense_splits` - Split details
- `categories` - Custom categories
- `upi_ids` - UPI payment IDs
- `notifications` - User notifications
- `user_preferences` - User settings

✅ All foreign keys properly set up
✅ All constraints in place

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Current Auth Flow:
```
1. User signs in with PIN
2. API validates PIN against pin_hash in users table
3. API creates JWT session token
4. API sets cookie with session token
5. Frontend redirects to dashboard
6. ❌ Cookie not being sent with subsequent requests
7. ❌ API calls fail due to no session
```

### Expected Auth Flow:
```
1. User signs in with PIN
2. API validates PIN
3. API creates JWT session token
4. API sets cookie with session token
5. Frontend redirects to dashboard
6. ✅ Cookie sent with all API requests
7. ✅ API validates session
8. ✅ Operations succeed
```

### The Gap:
Step 6 is failing - cookie not being sent or not being read properly.

## 💡 Next Steps

1. Get debug info from `/api/debug/session`
2. Check console logs during payment creation
3. Identify exact point of failure
4. Implement proper fix
5. Test end-to-end flow
6. Re-enable middleware with proper auth

## 🚨 Temporary Workarounds Applied

1. **Middleware disabled** for main routes - allows dashboard to load
2. **localStorage backup** - stores userId after signin
3. **Extensive logging** - tracks session validation flow

These are temporary and need proper fixes!
