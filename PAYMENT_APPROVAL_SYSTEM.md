# Payment Approval System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive payment approval workflow for group expenses with UPI QR code integration and chat visibility.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Approval Workflow
**Flow:**
1. Member clicks "Pay Now" button
2. Dialog shows:
   - Amount to pay
   - UPI QR code (if payer has UPI)
   - Payment instructions
3. Member completes payment and clicks "Request Approval"
4. Status changes to "Waiting for [payer] to confirm"
5. Payer sees "Review Payments" button
6. Payer can:
   - ✅ **Approve** - Marks as settled
   - ❌ **Didn't Receive** - Rejects with reason, allows retry

### 2. Database Schema Updates
**New columns in `group_expense_splits`:**
- `payment_requested_at` - When member requested approval
- `payment_approved` - Boolean flag
- `payment_approved_at` - Approval timestamp
- `payment_rejected` - Boolean flag
- `payment_rejected_at` - Rejection timestamp
- `rejection_reason` - Why payment was rejected

### 3. API Routes Created
- `POST /api/expense-splits/[id]/request-approval` - Member requests approval
- `POST /api/expense-splits/[id]/approve` - Payer approves payment
- `POST /api/expense-splits/[id]/reject` - Payer rejects payment

### 4. UI Improvements
- **Chat Button** - Added to group header (placeholder for future implementation)
- **Payment Dialog** - Shows QR code first, then approval button
- **Review Dialog** - Payer can review all pending payment requests
- **Status Indicators** - Shows waiting status for pending approvals

## User Experience

### For Payer (Receiving)
